# OlinQEA2_FlatlandChallenge

This repository contains the MATLAB code and associated files for the flatland project of QEA2 (Spring 24) of Olin College. It includes the main scripts, functions, and data required to simulate and analyze the robot's movement and sensor data.

## Repository Contents

- `NeatoVelocities.m`: A MATLAB script provided by the instructor to calculate velocities of the Neato robot.
- `data.mat`: A MATLAB data file containing the collected data from robot simulations.
- `graphs/`: A directory containing graphs in JPG format that visualize various aspects of the robot's performance.
- `judp.m`: A MATLAB function provided by the instructor for UDP communication.
- `myRobotProgram.m`: A MATLAB script provided by the instructor with robot program routines.
- `neato.m`: A MATLAB script provided by the instructor for Neato robot simulation.
- `NeatoSensors.m`: A MATLAB function provided by the instructor to simulate Neato robot sensors.
- `neatoSim.m`: A MATLAB script provided by the instructor for simulating the Neato robot.
- `gradient_ascent.m`: A MATLAB script that runs a gradient ascent agorithm for the Neato robot.
- `run_neato.mlx`: A Matlab live script that runes `gradient_ascent.m`.
- `run_neato.pdf` : A PDF file with a captured output from `run_neato.mlx`.

## Usage

To use this repository, clone it to your local machine and open the files in MATLAB. Ensure you have all the dependencies installed as provided by the instructor at [MeetoYourNeato](https://qeacourse.github.io/NeatoRobo/How_To/meeto_your_neato).  

## Data Visualization

The `graphs` folder contains visualizations of the robot's performance. These include plots of angular velocity, linear speed over time, and individual wheel velocities. Refer to the individual JPG files for detailed legends and captions.
